How to configure Autosubmit
===========================

There are two methods of configuring the Autosubmit main paths.

* ``autosubmit configure`` is suited for a personal/single user who wants to test Autosubmit in the scope of ``$HOME``. It will generate an ``$HOME/.autosubmitrc`` file that overrides the machine configuration.

Manually generate an ``autosubmitrc`` file in one of these locations, which is the recommended method for a production environment with a shared database in a manner that multiple users can share and view others' experiments.

* ``/etc/autosubmitrc``, System level configuration.

* Set the environment variable ``AUTOSUBMIT_CONFIGURATION`` to the path of the ``autosubmitrc`` file. This will override all other configuration files.

.. important::  ``.autosubmitrc`` user level precedes system configuration unless the environment variable is set. ``AUTOSUBMIT_CONFIGURATION`` > ``$HOME/.autosubmitrc`` > ``/etc/autosubmitrc``

Quick Installation - Non-shared database (user level)
------------------------------------------------------

After the package installation, set up Autosubmit with the following sequence of commands:

::

    autosubmit configure
    autosubmit install

When running ``autosubmit configure``, you have to configure at least the database and path for Autosubmit.

``autosubmit configure`` will always generate a file called ``.autosubmitrc`` in your ``$HOME``.
``autosubmit install`` creates the directories defined in that file (experiments path, logs, metadata) and initialises the database.

.. important::
    In Autosubmit ``<= 4.1.16``, ``autosubmit configure`` created the directories itself.
    From the next release onwards, directory creation is the responsibility of ``autosubmit install``.
    If you are upgrading, make sure to run ``autosubmit install`` after ``autosubmit configure``.


You can add ``--advanced`` to the configure command for advanced options.

::

    autosubmit configure --advanced

It will allow you to choose different directories:

* Experiments path and database name (``$HOME/autosubmit/`` by default) and database name (``$HOME/autosubmit/autosubmit.db`` by default)
* Path for the global logs (those not belonging to any experiment). Default is ``$HOME/autosubmit/logs``.
* Autosubmit metadata. Default is ``$HOME/autosubmit/metadata/``

Additionally, it also provides the possibility of configuring an SMTP server and an email account to use the email notifications feature.

.. hint::
    The ``dialog`` (GUI) library is optional. Otherwise, the configuration parameters will be prompted (CLI). Use ``autosubmit configure -h`` to see all the allowed options.

Example - Local - .autosubmitrc skeleton
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: ini

   [database]
   path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit
   filename = autosubmit.db

   [local]
   path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit

   [globallogs]
   path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit/logs

   [structures]
   path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit/metadata/structures

   [historicdb]
   path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit/metadata/data

   [historiclog]
   path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit/metadata/logs


Production environment installation - Shared-Filesystem database
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. _Shared-Filesystem:

.. warning:: Keep in mind the .autosubmitrc precedence. If you, as a user, have a .autosubmitrc generated in the quick-installation, you have to delete or rename it before using the production environment installation.

Create an ``/etc/autosubmitrc`` file or move it from ``$HOME/.autosubmitrc`` to ``/etc/autosubmitrc`` with the information as follows:

Mandatory parameters of /etc/autosubmit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: ini

    [database]
    # Accessible for all users of the filesystem
    path = <database_path>
    # Experiment database name can be whatever.
    filename = autosubmit.db

    # Accessible for all users of the filesystem, can be the same as database_path
    [local]
    path = <experiment_path>

    # Global logs, logs without <EXPID> associated.
    [globallogs]
    path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit/logs

    # This depends on your email server and can be left empty if not applicable
    [mail]
    smtp_server = mail.bsc.es
    mail_from = automail@bsc.es

Recommendable parameters of /etc/autosubmit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameters are the Autosubmit metadata, it is not mandatory, but it is recommendable to have them set up as some of them can positively affect the Autosubmit performance.

.. code-block:: ini

   [structures]
   path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit/metadata/structures

   [historicdb]
   path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit/metadata/data

   [historiclog]
   path = /home/dbeltran/autosubmit/metadata/logs

Optional parameters of /etc/autosubmit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These parameters provide extra functionalities to Autosubmit.

.. code-block:: ini

    [conf]
    # Allows using a different jobs_<EXPID>.yml default template on `autosubmit expid ``
    jobs = <path_jobs>/jobs_<EXPID>.yml
    # Allows using a different platforms_<EXPID>.yml default template on `autosubmit expid `
    platforms = <path_platforms>platforms_<EXPID>.yml> path to any jobs.yml

    # Autosubmit API includes extra information for some Autosubmit functions. It is optional to have access to it to use Autosubmit.
    [autosubmitapi]
    # Autosubmit API (The API is right now only provided inside the BSC network), which enables extra features for the Autosubmit GUI
    url = <url of the Autosubmit API>:<port>

    # Used for controlling the traffic that comes from Autosubmit.
    [hosts]
    authorized =  [<command1,commandN> <machine1,machineN>]
    forbidden =   [<command1,commandN> <machine1,machineN>]

About hosts parameters:

From 3.14+ onwards, the users can tailor Autosubmit commands to run on specific machines. Previously, only the run was affected by the deprecated whitelist parameter.

* authorized =  [<command1,commandN> <machine1,machineN>] list of machines that can run given autosubmit commands. If the list is empty, all machines are allowed.
* forbidden =   [<command1,commandN> <machine1,machineN>] list of machines that cannot run given autosubmit commands. If the list is empty, no machine is forbidden.

Example - BSC - /etc/autosubmitrc skeleton
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: ini

   [database]
   path = /esarchive/autosubmit
   filename = ecearth.db

   [local]
   path = /esarchive/autosubmit

   [conf]
   jobs = /esarchive/autosubmit/default
   platforms = /esarchive/autosubmit/default

   [mail]
   smtp_server = mail.bsc.es
   mail_from = automail@bsc.es

   [hosts]
        authorized =  [run bscearth000,bscesautosubmit01,bscesautosubmit02] [stats, clean, describe, check, report,dbfix,pklfix, upgrade,updateversion all]
        forbidden =  [expìd, create, recovery, delete, inspect, monitor, recovery, configure,setstatus,testcase, test, refresh, archive, unarchive bscearth000,bscesautosubmit01,bscesautosubmit02]

Experiments database and directories installation
===================================================

As the last step, ensure to install the Autosubmit database. To do so, execute  ``autosubmit install``.

.. code-block:: bash

    autosubmit install

This creates the Autosubmit directories and generates a blank database at the configured path.

.. note::
    In versions ``<= 4.1.16``, directory creation was done by ``autosubmit configure``.
